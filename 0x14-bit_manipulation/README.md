unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b) -converts unsigned int to binary number string. 
void print_binary(unsigned long int n); - prints the binary representation of a number
int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)-a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)-a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)-a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)-a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
int get_endianness(void)-a function that checks the endianness.
